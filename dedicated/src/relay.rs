//! The game server's UDP side: a NerdCore relay (nerd.rs has the formats). First ported from
//! `tools/online/server/relay.py` of fh2-mods (github.com/conner-mcvay/fh2-mods).
//!
//! Each console (peer) gets the server's side of a connection: OpenConnection is answered Ok,
//! the console's ResponseAck gets TimeSync and ConnectionSyncDone, Pings get Pongs, sequenced
//! packets are acked, and the server pings every half second (consoles drop a server that is
//! quiet for 10 s).
//!
//! Objects: the server owns one object itself, the lobby's SessionHost (router 6, type 0), which
//! consoles wait for before they finish joining (stateflow network_matchmaking.xml
//! wait_for_session_host). Every object a console creates, updates or deletes on a forwarded
//! router is forwarded to the other consoles with the relay handle (its owner's peer index), and
//! kept in a history that late joiners get as a snapshot. Cars (CarPredictionFull, ~30 a second,
//! unsequenced) are forwarded the same way and not kept.
//!
//! History (fix: relay.py kept every message forever and replayed all of them). The receiver
//! applies object updates strictly in seq order (1417B1E70: link+1 mod 255; newer ones wait for
//! the gap, older ones are dropped), and a Create sets the link to its own seq. Payloads are
//! (var index, data) lists read to the end (1417B2510), so updates can be concatenated: a
//! later entry for a var overwrites the earlier one. So each object keeps:
//!   - `base`: the Create's payload with the oldest updates appended, under the seq of the last
//!     one appended; a late joiner gets it as one Create with that seq, so the owner's next live
//!     update (seq+1) applies right after;
//!   - `tail`: the updates that no longer fit in base (u14 payload size), in seq order, replayed
//!     verbatim after the Create (at most TAIL_MAX of them and TAIL_MAX_BITS);
//!   - `pending`: updates that came ahead of a gap, until the owner's resend fills it.
//!
//! When the tail is full its oldest update is folded into base if it fits, else dropped: a late
//! joiner then misses that update's vars until they change again (logged once per object).
//!
//! Duplicates (fix: relay.py's dedup set grew forever): consoles resend unacked messages, and
//! a message is new only if its seq is newer than the object's (or, ahead of a gap, not pending
//! yet). That state is the history itself, so it is bounded with it.
//!
//! Reliability (fix): consoles drop out-of-order updates and wait on gaps, so a lost packet of
//! object messages would stall that object for good. Our sequenced packets are kept until the
//! console acks them (the ack and ack bits of its packet headers) and resent in a new packet
//! otherwise; a console that never acks is dropped.
//!
//! Peers: by address, plus the XUID from OpenConnection. A console that starts over (an
//! OpenConnection in packet 0), goes quiet for 15 s or closes the connection is dropped, and the
//! others get an ObjectDelete for each of its objects. Only an OpenConnection makes a peer: other
//! packets from unknown addresses are ignored. Peer indices are 1..=254, handed out round-robin
//! so a freed index is reused as late as possible (receivers remember deletes per handle,
//! 1417AB560, and drop a Create with an older seq for it).
//!
//! The group's GPS (SetGroupSatNavEvent, 52): a console asks the server to set the group's
//! destination, and consoles do not act on the message themselves (their ILobbyEvents slot for it
//! is `return false`), so it is not relayed: the server sets its SessionHost's GroupSatNavNode
//! var instead, with an ObjectUpdate to every console, and a late joiner gets it in the
//! SessionHost's Create.
//!
//! Game messages carry no length, so a packet is read only as far as its messages are known; the
//! rest is dropped (the packet is still acked) and each unknown message id is logged once.
//!
//! Security. Everything a peer sends ends up in the other players' games, whose deserializers
//! trust their input (MsgCollObjDetachPart's reader copies up to 2047 bytes into a 1024-byte
//! stack buffer; NetworkName's reader keeps a count it did not read). So:
//!   - Forwarded: only cars (15), car events (20, 21, 35) and ObjectCreate / Update / Delete on
//!     routers 1, 2 and 3 (nerd::forwarded_router), each written again from what was read:
//!     payloads var by var (nerd::sanitize_payload: indices, duplicates, widths, finite floats in
//!     range, NetworkName length, ConsoleSynced's server vars stripped, a size cap per router),
//!     car positions and event floats checked (nerd::car_ok, car_event_ok). Everything else is
//!     read only to get past it.
//!   - Car states (carstate.rs: the ExtraOptions headlights and roof the game does not send): a
//!     private STUN indication, never NerdCore. Taken from a synced peer's own address with its
//!     own XUID, or from loopback for the loopback peer of that XUID (the host's hook), one per
//!     50 ms at most, values in range; passed on (on a change and every second) only to peers
//!     whose hook has spoken one, so never into a game socket.
//!   - Handshake: our OpenConnectionResponse carries a random attempt per peer, which the
//!     console's ResponseAck must echo before it counts as connected (a spoofed source address
//!     never sees it). Until then the peer gets only handshake replies, never more bytes than
//!     it sent, is not a player (max_players), and is dropped after `unsynced_timeout`.
//!     Handshake replies are capped per IP per second, peers per IP, and peers waiting.
//!   - XUIDs: a peer cannot change its XUID; a newcomer with the XUID of a connected player
//!     replaces it only once it has proven its address and the old one has been quiet for
//!     `takeover_quiet` (otherwise it is turned away).
//!   - Limits per peer: token buckets on packets, messages and bytes (sustained excess drops the
//!     peer), its history (`history_max_bits`), what waits to be sent to it (snapshot cap, paced).
//!   - Access: commands on stdin (main.rs; never the network): `kick <xuid> [reason]` drops the
//!     player, who may come back at once (a player whose car database changed is kept out by
//!     the server, which no longer sends them to a world); `allow <ip>` and `allowonly 1|0`
//!     restrict who may connect (loopback always may).
//!   - A packet that panics the handling is dropped and logged once per address; log lines are
//!     stripped of control characters, and refusals are logged at most once per IP per minute.
